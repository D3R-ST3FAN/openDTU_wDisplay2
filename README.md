Based on idea/ realization of breakout board 
https://github.com/dokuhn/openDTU-BreakoutBoard

2nd version with much smaller PCB (1st version: https://github.com/SteffMUC/openDTU_wDisplay)
Target is to have ESP32 on backside, Display and nRF24l01 on frontside.
Board will get dedicated case with stand in order to have the capability to put it upright on a shelf.

2023-02-28: boards received, soldered, working reliable, pics in picture folder, case currently in progress - not yet perfectly fitting 
2023-03-01: 

Final printing of case done, got some requests for spare PCBs, all spare PCBs now gone, if you need a PCB, you can easily upload the gerber zip file on any PCB manufacturer, e.g. PLCPCB (10 pieces, with customs to Germany in 2 weeks roughly 14 EUR).

In case you are looking for a cheap source for the capacitors, I ordered mine with Christians_Shop at Amazon (they have a direct website as well):
https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B01MTSDA58/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Known limitations: 
Backside silkscreen is not mirrored, in Kicad, still needs to be fixed, result is mirrored text on backside (for new orders).
If you print the case: The holders for the PCB are not yet perfectly aligned (need 0.5mm adjust), I "clipped" 3 of them away to avoid reprinting, everything can be printed without support, expect for the ikea holder.
